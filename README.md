This project analyzes YouTube trending videos between the years 2017-2018. We have data from Canada, Germany, France, England, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, and the US. We attempt to analyze these video to find which characteristics could make a video on YouTube trending. We look at relationships between views, likes, dislikes, the number of comments, keywords in the titles, descriptions, and tags, popular publish times, and popular trending dates of videos. Many of these characteristics and more contribute to a video's trending status. 

To run this project you must have pandas, pyspark, and wordcloud installed. 

To install wordcloud: pip install wordcloud
